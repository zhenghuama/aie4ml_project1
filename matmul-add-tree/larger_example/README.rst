Adder-Tree Matrix Multiplication (4x768x128)
==============================================

This version of addition-tree matrix multiplication works for int16 across 29 tiles (24 multiplication tiles and 5 addition tiles)

The larger version is essentially an extrapolation of the smaller version. See smaller_example for a more in-depth explaination of the adder-tree program
